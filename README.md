# Introduction

Data engineering is a crucial aspect of any data-driven organisation. It involves the collection, transformation and storage of data to enable effective data analysis and the facilitation of decision-making.

This project provides a framework to observe various data engineering tasks such as scraping, storing, containerizing and visualizing basic statistics with various python methods.

# **ðŸš€ Latest project done :**

MotoGP basic stats (update every Monday)

# ðŸš€ Goal of this project :
Scrape MotoGP website, process and store datas collected, create a dashboard and schedule it every week

ðŸ”¹ Language : Python <img src="./icons/python.svg" alt="request_logo" width="50" height="50"> with Pandas <img src="./icons/pandas.svg" alt="request_logo" width="50" height="50">

ðŸ”¹ Tools : requests library <img src="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/requests-sidebar.png" alt="request_logo" width="50" height="50"> , Docker <img src="./icons/docker.svg" alt="request_logo" width="50" height="50"> , Google BigQuery <img src="./icons/googlebigquery.svg" alt="request_logo" width="50" height="50"> , LookerStudio <img src="./icons/looker.svg" alt="request_logo" width="50" height="50"> and Apache Airflow <img src="./icons/apacheairflow.svg" alt="request_logo" width="50" height="50">

# ðŸš€ Project Steps :

- Scrape seasons and their IDs
- Scrape MotoGP category ID
- Scrape Events datas (name, ID , circuit and country, date)
- Scrape Circuits coordinates
- Scrape Races results
- Upload into Google BigQuery
- Create Dockerfile
- Create Apache Airflow DAGs (1 to run localy ; 1 to run dockerized)

# ðŸš€ Highlights:

End-to-End project with basic dashboard and most common data tools
